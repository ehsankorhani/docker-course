# Microservices architecture with Docker containers
A path to build a master Docker and Kubernetes.

<br>

## Why Docker

Docker allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

<br>

### Images and containers

A Docker image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.

As a developer, we can think of image as a ```class```. Then container is an ```instance``` of that class.

Container is just a running process. Only with extra features to isolate it from the host and other containers.

The process that runs in the operating system is called ```Daemon```. Daemon manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.
